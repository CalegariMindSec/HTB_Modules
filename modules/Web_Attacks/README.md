# Web Attacks

#### HTTP Verb Tampering

The first web attack discussed in this module is [HTTP Verb Tampering](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/03-Testing_for_HTTP_Verb_Tampering). An HTTP Verb Tampering attack exploits web servers that accept many  HTTP verbs and methods. This can be exploited by sending malicious  requests using unexpected methods, which may lead to bypassing the web  application's authorization mechanism or even bypassing its security  controls against other web attacks. HTTP Verb Tampering attacks are one  of many other HTTP attacks that can be used to exploit web server  configurations by sending malicious HTTP requests.

#### Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

The second attack discussed in this module is [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/05-Authorization_Testing/04-Testing_for_Insecure_Direct_Object_References). IDOR is among the most common web vulnerabilities and can lead to  accessing data that should not be accessible by attackers. What makes  this attack very common is essentially the lack of a solid access  control system on the back-end. As web applications store users' files  and information, they may use sequential numbers or user IDs to identify each item. Suppose the web application lacks a robust access control  mechanism and exposes direct references to files and resources. In that  case, we may access other users' files and information by simply  guessing or calculating their file IDs.

#### XML External Entity (XXE) Injection

The third and final web attack we will discuss is [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing). Many web applications process XML data as part of their functionality.  Suppose a web application utilizes outdated XML libraries to parse and  process XML input data from the front-end user. In that case, it may be  possible to send malicious XML data to disclose local files stored on  the back-end server. These files may be configuration files that may  contain sensitive information like passwords or even the source code of  the web application, which would enable us to perform a Whitebox  Penetration Test on the web application to identify more  vulnerabilities. XXE attacks can even be leveraged to steal the hosting  server's credentials, which would compromise the entire server and allow for remote code execution.
